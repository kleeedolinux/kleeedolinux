## About Me

I'm a technology and innovation enthusiast passionate about creating and solving problems. My journey into programming started with Python, Lua, and Node.js, and I continue to explore other languages. 

## Projects

Currently, I’m engaged in various projects that challenge and teach me constantly. I’ve created private repositories, such as **Bossaprotocol**, and adapted **PHPBank** for **NeoBank**, a project aimed at micronational banks. I'm also diving into game development and social media, where I believe we can create experiences that genuinely connect people.

## Education

I'm a student of **UI/UX Design**, an area that fascinates me because it allows me to understand how to provide meaningful and intuitive experiences for users. I believe that the way we interact with technology should be as fluid and enjoyable as the technology we create.

## Mathematics and Learning

Mathematics has always been a fundamental part of my life. I was a medalist in the **São Paulo Math Olympiad**, an experience that not only expanded my problem-solving abilities but also motivated me to share my knowledge. As Bill Gates wisely noted: _“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.”_

## Philosophy of Life

I believe we should be open to learning from everyone, regardless of their background. Lee Kuan Yew once said: _“While most Third World countries denounced the exploitation by Western multinationals, we invited them all to Singapore. This way we achieved growth, technology, and scientific knowledge, which skyrocketed our productivity more intensely and rapidly than any other alternative economic policy could have.”_

**Design is function, not form.** — *Steve Jobs*

**It doesn’t make sense to look back and think: I should have done this or that, I should have been there. That doesn’t matter. Let’s invent tomorrow and stop worrying about the past.** — *Steve Jobs*

**Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.** — *Bill Gates*

## My Perspective

Life is a continuous learning experience, and I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. It doesn’t make sense to look back and think, _“I should have done this or that.”_ What truly matters is inventing tomorrow.

Let’s embark on this journey of discovery and innovation together!
