## About Me

Iâ€™m a tech and innovation enthusiast, passionate about creating and solving problems. My journey in the programming world began with Python, Lua, and Node.js, and Iâ€™m continuing to explore other languages.

## Projects

Currently, Iâ€™m involved in a few projects that challenge and constantly teach me new things. Iâ€™ve created private repositories like **Bossaprotocol** and adapted **PHPBank** into **NeoBank**, a project focused on micronational banking. Iâ€™m also diving into game development and social networks, where I believe we can create experiences that truly connect people.

## Education

Iâ€™m a **UI/UX Design** student, a field that fascinates me because it allows me to understand how to deliver meaningful and intuitive experiences to users. I believe the way we interact with technology should be as smooth and enjoyable as the technology we create.

## Math and Learning

Math has always been a fundamental part of my life. I earned a medal in the **SÃ£o Paulo Mathematics Olympiad**, an experience that not only expanded my problem-solving skills but also motivated me to share my knowledge. As Bill Gates wisely said: _"Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning."_

## Life Philosophy

I believe that we should be open to learning from everyone, regardless of their background. Lee Kuan Yew once said: _"While most Third World countries were condemning Western multinational corporations for exploitation, we invited them to Singapore. That way, we gained growth, technology, and scientific knowledge."_

## My Perspective

Life is a continuous learning journey, and Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Thereâ€™s no point in looking back and thinking: _"I should have done this or that."_ What truly matters is inventing tomorrow.

Letâ€™s walk together in this journey of discovery and innovation!

## Connect with Me

Feel free to contact me or follow my projects. Iâ€™m always open to new ideas and collaborations! ðŸŒŸ
